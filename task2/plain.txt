The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key encryption
and some common attacks on encryption. From this lab, students will gain a first-hand experience on
encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). Moreover, students will be able
to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages.
Many common mistakes have been made by developers in using the encryption algorithms and modes.
These mistakes weaken the strength of the encryption, and eventually lead to vulnerabilities. This lab
exposes students to some of these mistakes, and ask students to launch attacks to exploit those vulnerabilities.
This lab covers the following topics:
• Secret-key encryption
• Substitution cipher and frequency analysis
• Encryption modes, IV, and paddings
• Common mistakes in using encryption algorithms
• Programming using the crypto library
Readings. Detailed coverage of the secret-key encryption can be found in the following:
• Chapter 21 of the SEED Book, Computer & Internet Security: A Hands-on Approach, 2nd Edition,

Lab Environment. This lab has been tested on our pre-built Ubuntu 20.04 VM, which can be downloaded
from the SEED website.
